# A Ukulele Tuner

Inspired by Matt Zucker's [ukulele tuner](https://mzucker.github.io/2016/08/07/ukulele-tuner.html) and [GuitarTuna](https://yousician.com/guitartuna). Uses an AnalyserNode from the Web Audio API to perform FFT and get pitch of ukulele from frequency data.

## Installation

Just run it like any other React project.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kejcao/ukulele-tuner
$ cd ukulele-tuner
$ npm start
```
